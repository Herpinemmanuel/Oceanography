# Case 4 : New Run

Replace harmonic diffusion/viscosity model by a schema of LEITH 
Documentation : http://mitgcm.org/public/r2_manual/latest/online_documents/node86.html#SECTION003211400000000000000

Change advection schema for Temperature : less diffusive than the three first cases

Edit advection schema in moment equations : centered differences to a schema which keeps Kinetic energy during more time

In this case we restored atmospheric conditions.
